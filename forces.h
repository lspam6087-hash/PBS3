 * and bonded interactions (e.g., bond-stretch, angle-bend, dihedral-torsion).

 * are not directly bonded. These forces are usually calculated using the Lennard-Jones potential,
 * with a cutoff distance applied to limit the interaction range. The Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules
 * may be implemented for cross-species interactions in the case of multi-component systems.

 * @brief Calculate bond-stretch forces for directly bonded particles.

 * covalent bonds. A harmonic potential is typically used to model these interactions,

 * @brief Calculate angle-bend forces between sets of three bonded particles (angles).
 * 
 * This function computes the forces associated with the bending of angles between 
 * bonded triplets of particles (i.e., particles i-j-k). These forces are typically modeled using 
 * a harmonic potential, where the force depends on the deviation of the bond angle from its 
 * equilibrium value.

 * @brief Calculate dihedral-torsion forces between sets of four bonded particles (dihedrals).
 * 
 * Dihedral forces arise from the torsional interaction between four connected particles 
 * (i-j-k-l). These forces are modeled using a potential that depends on the dihedral angle 
 * formed between the bonds. Dihedral potentials can be periodic and are critical for simulating
 * complex molecules like ethane.
